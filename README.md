### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Sheng Fan, but you can call me Fred. I'm a 16-year-old student based in Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China.

I'm a bit of a jack-of-all-trades when it comes to my work with @CivilizationGame. I wear many hats, including IT manager, programmer, and coder. But at the end of the day, I'm passionate about all things code ðŸ’» and it's a big part of my life.

Currently, I'm preparing for a huge examination that could rewrite the route of my life, so perhaps I'm not working on anything about coding.

Coding is not just a hobby for me, it's a passion ðŸ”¥. I love the creativity and problem-solving that comes with it ðŸ¤”, and I'm constantly looking for ways to improve my skills ðŸ“š and learn new things.

If you would like to contact me, you can reach me at fredtools999@gmail.com.
