## Sheng Fan / fred913 👨‍💻

**Full-Stack Developer | Open Source Contributor**

Hey there! I'm a 17-year-old developer from Hangzhou, China, currently studying at Hangzhou Electronics & Information Vocational School. I've been coding for a while now, and what started as a hobby has become my biggest passion.

### What I'm Into
- **Open Source**: I love contributing to projects and collaborating with developers worldwide
- **Full-Stack Development**: Building complete applications from frontend to backend
- **Distributed Systems**: Always curious about how large-scale systems work and scale

I'm constantly learning new technologies and enjoy the problem-solving aspect of development. There's something satisfying about debugging a tricky issue or architecting a clean solution that just works.

When I'm not coding, you'll probably find me exploring the latest tech trends or working on side projects that challenge me to grow as a developer.
